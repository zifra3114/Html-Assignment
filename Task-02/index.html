    <p><center><font size="6">M</font><font>uhammad Ali Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan and its first   Governor-General. His real name was Muhammad Iqbal, but he was given the title "Quaid-e-Azam," which means "Great Leader." Jinnah received his education in Bombay and London, becoming a distinguished lawyer. His role in the creation of Pakistan is of immense significance, as he laid the foundation for a separate homeland for Muslims and    led them through his leadership and determination to achieve this goal.
      <br><br>
      <center>Jinnah's political vision was to understand and resolve the Hindu-Muslim conflict. For the last decade of his life, he dedicated himself to Pakistan, leading the Muslim League and guiding them towards the realization of a new nation. In 1940, in the Lahore Resolution, he formally demanded the creation of Pakistan, and thereafter worked tirelessly to bring this vision to reality.
      </center><br><br>
      <center>During his leadership, Quaid-e-Azam worked to establish a strong and just government. Until his last days, he focused on developing Pakistanâ€™s fundamental frameworks, such as the constitution and democratic practices. His vision was for Pakistan to be a nation where every individual would have the right to self-determination and equality. Quaid-e-Azam passed away on 11th September 1948, leaving Pakistan without its great leader, but his legacy and his work continue to inspire the nation.
